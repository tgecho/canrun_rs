Works with the [`DomainType<T>`](DomainType) trait to allow access to actual
values.

Domains are typically generated with the [`domain!`](./macro.domain.html)
macro. There isn't currently much use case for interacting with a domain
directly in user code. The only reason it is public is to allow implementing
custom domains through the macro.

```
use canrun::{State, Goal, unify, var};

canrun::domain! {
    MyDomain {
        i32
    }
}

# fn main() -> () {
let x = var();
let state: State<MyDomain> = State::new();
let goal: Goal<MyDomain> = unify(x, 1);
# }
```

/** Generate [Domain] structs and other associated types and impls.

Manually implementing a [Domain] would be tedious and finicky. This macro
attempts to simplify most of the general cases by building out everything
required to reason about values of various types.

A few [example domains](crate::example) are available for simple
use cases.

# Examples
Begin each declaration with the domain keyword.
```
canrun::domain! {
    MyDomain { i32 }
}
# fn main() -> () {}
# // keep this `-> ()` to quell `needless_doctest_main` warning
# // https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/4698
```

The optional [visibility
modifier](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/visibility-and-privacy.html)
works just as in normal Rust.
```
canrun::domain! {
    pub MyPublicDomain { i32 }
}
# fn main() {}
```

You can define multiple values, include structures. Note that a wrapping
[`Val`](crate::value::Val) is required in the tuple.
```
use canrun::Val;
canrun::domain! {
    pub MyBigDomain {
        i32,
        String,
        (Val<i32>, Val<String>),
    }
}
# fn main() {}
```

Any types you add to a domain must implement the
[`UnifyIn`](crate::unify::UnifyIn) trait. Canrun includes default
implementations for most simple built in types (use cases welcome for
more!) and [collection types are available](crate::collections).

Once you have a domain, you can use it to parameterize other types, such as
[`State`](crate::state::State) and [`Goal`](crate::goals::Goal):
```
# use canrun::state::State;
# use canrun::goals::{Goal, unify};
# use canrun::value::var;
# canrun::domain! { MyDomain { i32 } }
# fn main() {
# let x = var();
let state: State<MyDomain> = State::new();
let goal: Goal<MyDomain> = unify(x, 1);
# }
```

pub use canrun_codegen::domain;
